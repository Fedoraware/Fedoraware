## Notes
- It is recommended to use dxlevel 90+ due to issues with imgui.
- You will have issues with injecting if you are on Windows 10 upgraded from Windows 7.
- The source code is most likely __DETECTED__, use a VMProtected manual mapping injector or [VAC Bypass by danielkrupinski](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/VAC-Bypass). Any of these methods could be useless in the future, and end up getting you VAC Banned. We are not responsible for anything that could happen to your account.

## Guide:
- If you are lazy and you just want a compiled .dll file, go to the [Actions](https://github.com/M-FeD/Fedoraware/actions) tab of this repo and select the latest workflow, and then select the Fedoraware button under the Artifacts category. This will download a zip file which you'll need to extract, after that you will get the .dll file.
- To inject Fedoraware into TF2, you'll have to also use an injector like [Xenos](https://github.com/relaxtakenotes/xenos) to inject it into TF2.
- __If you have any problems, you can leave them - [Issues](https://github.com/M-FeD/Fedoraware/issues)__
- Should you choose to compile this cheat yourself, you may enable enhanced instruction sets to possibly increase performance. __Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Enable Enhanced Instruction Set__. Be sure to check what's the best instruction set you can use by checking in [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html), otherwise the cheat won't work on your PC.

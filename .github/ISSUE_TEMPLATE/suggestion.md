**Quick Description**

<!-- A clear description of the feature you're requesting, as well as what you would like it to do. -->

<!-- Example: I would like to suggest Spy Alert. It would show you a warning when there is a spy nearby you with his knife out. -->



**The Issue**

<!-- Is your feature based on an issue? Tell us what the problem is, as well as why you've come up with this suggestion to fix the problem. -->

<!-- Example: I keep getting backstabbed! I just can't tell when there are players behind me with ESP. I would like for a spy alert to be added, so that I could be alarmed if I'm about to be backstabbed. -->



**My Suggestion for Developers**

<!-- Can you give us some ideas you've come up with to add the feature? Anything's appreciated, such as options for the feature the feature, console commands, everything! The more you provide, the better we can create the feature you have in your mind just like you've thought of it. -->

<!-- Example: There should be a simple toggle in Misc called "Spy Alert". Maybe you could also add a setting to automatically say "No!" with voice commands? A slider that allows you to customize the distance would also be nice. -->



**Additional Context**

<!-- Is this feature in another cheat? Do you have a video showcasing it? Anything leftover that you might want to add, or to let us know about? -->

<!-- Example: A lot of other TF2 cheats have this. It's really necessary, so you should add it! It will really help a lot. Also, I think it would be cool if you could make the text turn from yellow to red if they getting closer! -->
